"""
The 'bot' package contains the core logic for interacting with Instagram,
managing sessions, and performing engagement actions.
"""
# For direct imports like `from bot import InstagramBot`, add them here:
# from .instagram_bot import InstagramBot
# from .actions import EngagementActions
# from .session_manager import SessionManager
# from .anti_detection import human_delay, get_random_user_agent

# Leaving it empty is also fine if you prefer explicit submodule imports.
